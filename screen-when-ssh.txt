Using screen only when logging in via SSH. This way, my SSH session is automatically resumed if I am disconnected for any reason. I do this by adding these lines to my ~/.bashrc:

Code:
if [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]; then
    if [ -z "$STY" ]; then
        # Screen is not currently running, but we are in SSH, so start a session
        exec screen -d -R
    fi
fi
